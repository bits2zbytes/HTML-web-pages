Prediction<p></font>
<font face="calibri">
Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.[62] However, for well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated.[63]<p>

Earthquake warning systems have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress, but before the ground surface has begun to move, potentially allowing people within the system's range to seek shelter before the earthquake's impact is felt.we can also detect an earthquake by observing the behaviour of animals<p><center><embed src="C:\Users\Public\Videos\Sample Videos\wildlife.wmv" height="250" width="350"><p></center>

<p>
The objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings and other structures and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes. Earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes.
<p>
Emergency management strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences.
